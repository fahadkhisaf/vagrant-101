- Ease of Use: Easy for developers to be able to use 

- Robustness: 100% Uptime, Fast and continuous Development

- Costs: Cap-ex & Ops-ex, Infrastructure, Downtime, Slow innovation 

## Devoops problems and solutions 

- Products must be able to work on more than one machine

- STANDARDIZED testing environment: This ensures funtionality
